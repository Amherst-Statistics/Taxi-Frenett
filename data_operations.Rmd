## Reverse geocoding NYC `long`/`lat` to zip codes

* Import geojson file to QGIS
    + For this to be done, the file must first be loaded to pgAdmin which will read the json file and then create a geometry column so it can be added/manipulated by PostGIS. A connection between the two pieces of software will have to be made.

* Import point data to pgAdmin
    + Create a new table and specify the columns of the point data (including `long`/`lat`)
    + Import .csv file to the table with header
    
* Create `location` and `zip` columns
    + `location` should be saved as public.geometry and `zip` should be a character string of length 5
    
* Populate `location` so that it will work with PostGIS
    + `UPDATE data SET location = ST_SetSRID(ST_MakePoint(longitude, latitude),4326)`
    + 4326 is the code for WGS 84, the global reference system used in GPS navigation
    
* Populate `zip` using PostGIS
    + `UPDATE data SET zip = zip_codes.postalcode FROM zip_codes WHERE ST_Within(data.location, zip_codes.geom)`
    
* Export data to .csv file from pgAdmin
    + `COPY data TO 'file_location' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER`
